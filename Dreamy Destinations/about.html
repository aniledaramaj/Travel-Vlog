              <h3 class="heading">Best Things to do in Florence </h3>
              <p>Florence is an ideal short city trip inside Europe. Follow the following things to do in Florence and have perfect 24 hours inside the city.</p>
              <h3>1. Palazzo Vecchio</h3>
              <p >Palazzo Vecchio is the current town hall of Florence. The medieval-looking Palazzo and the Piazza Della Signoria square in front are the historic center of the city, a place for people to gather. On the inside, the hall and rooms are beautifully decorated and open to visitors. It is open daily from 9 AM to 7 PM.</p>

              <br><br>
              <h3>2. Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore</h3>
              <p>Continue your walk towards Florence’s most popular thing to do: the Duomo of Florence (cathedral). The Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore is an architectural masterpiece that took over 140 years to complete. Its exterior is colored in white, pink, and green marble, and during the day, it seems to change color depending on the position of the sun.The cathedral is free to visit, and although it might look busy, the inside offers plenty of space, so the line is a short wait.</p>

              <br><br>
              <h3>3. All’Antico Vinaio – Must do in Florence!</h3>
              <p>After all that walking, you must be hungry. Well, get ready for an experience at All’Antico Vinaio. This panini shop has tasty and affordable paninis (sandwiches), and there is always a line through the entire street, yes, the entire street, haha! But wait, don’t let that scare you off. They actually own three or four shops all next or opposite to each other that all sell the same, so although the line looks long, it goes really fast. This is one of those things to do in Florence you should see!</p>

              <img src="images\All-Antico-Vinaio1.jpg" class="foto">
              <br><br>
              <h3>4. Ponte Vecchio</h3>
              <p>Make your way towards the Arno River, a short 5-min walk. Ponte Vecchio, built in 1345, was Florence’s first bridge over the river. It is so unique because it is the only bridge that wasn’t destroyed during the war. Nowadays, the bridge has shops selling gold and silver jewelry, so you won’t directly have the feeling you are crossing a bridge.</p>

              <img src="images\view.jpg" class="foto">
              <br><br>
              <h3>5. Santa Croce </h3>
              <p>Piazza Santa Croce and the Santa Croce Basilica are a little more between the locals. Cafes and street performers are making the square an excellent place to sit down, relax, and absorb the charming Florence vibe for a bit. </p>

              <br><br>
              <h3>6. Italian Dinner </h3>
              <p>A common misconception is that Florence is as expensive as Venice. Let’s prove them wrong. Have a delicious Italian dinner at Trattoria San Pierino or Ristorante Brandolino, where you have two freshly prepared portions of pasta and drinks for 20 EUR – 30 EUR.</p>

              <h3>1.By Car</h3>

              <p>Florence is easy to reach by train as the city is well-connected to all major stations in Italy. The international airport offers direct flights to many European cities. Getting from Rome to Florence only takes 80 minutes with the high-speed railway line.</p>

              <h3 class="heading"> Costs of travelling  </h3>
              <p>Florence is one of the most popular cities to visit in Italy and the capital of the Tuscany region. As such, prices do reflect this, with accommodation and transport costs peaking in the summer months. Book your trip in advance, however, and you can find some great deals.
          Expect to spend between $770 − $3670 USD per week per person in Florence, but costs depend on factors like accommodation, transportation, and activities. This price does not include flights.</p>

              <h3 class="heading">Best Time to Visit Florence</h3>
              <p>Florence is a great destination to visit all year round, particularly in the shoulder seasons of spring and fall when the days are sunny, but the temperatures are perfect for sightseeing.
          Summer is the busiest time to visit Florence, but the best time if you want to use the city as a jumping-off point to other destinations in Tuscany.</p>
